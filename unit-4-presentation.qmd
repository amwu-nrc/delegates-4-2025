## Inflation Tumbles!

## Inflation: Discussion

::: notes
**Context**

Inflation, under neo-liberalism has become the single most important economic priority.

This coincides with the increased dominance and 'importance' of the financial industry and the decline in productive industry like manufacturing.

Controlling inflation is More Important than:

-   full employment

-   reducing inequality

-   housing affordability

-   alleviating poverty

Instead of full employment, government and institutions now push the "non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment" which suggests there is a minimum level of unemployment necessary in order to stop wages growth and rising inflation. Of course, we can't measure the NAIRU, only show that it might exist, if a bunch of assumptions are made about how the economy works. Estimates from data suggest that it falls somewhere between 4 and 5%.

This means that it is explicit government policy to keep up-to 5% of the labour force out of work, in order to keep wages and inflation down.

Such policy MIGHT be palatable if there was a strong social safety net to support workers who lose their job and are looking for another one. Of course, we don't even get that, with only the below poverty JobSeeker payment available.

But it is still a very inefficient use of the labour power that our economy has access to. Why shouldn't someone who wants to work not have access to a job? It also means that policy is designed to discipline labour.

Which by the way, is why the budget in 2024, by the nominative party of labour, forecast that the plan was to tackle inflation by driving the unemployment rate UP to at least 4.5 percent by June 2025. Last weeks unemployment figures showed that unemployment unexpectedly had increased to 4.2%. It would be cold comfort for those who find themselves recently unemployed that they're doing their part to combat inflation and keep wages down!

## Productivity Disaster!

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdRCDaQrHJ0 width="100%" height="85%" >}}

## Productivity: Discussion

::: notes
Productivity is possibly the most misunderstood economic indicator, but simultaneously one of the most spoken about. The newly elected government has set its focus on productivity, and productivity growth, and has got the Productivity Commission in on the action.

The Productivity Commission by the way, should be seen as a complete joke. It was created by the Howard government in the 1990s, and sits within the Treasury department.

In a FWC hearing in 2025, the chief economist of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (also a joke) was asked "what factors drove productivity". He answered that "the Productivity Commission was currently examining those factors". 35 years since their establishment, and the Productivity Commission is still examining what productivity even is!!!

As an example of how productivity is misunderstood, here's a quote from the Australian Constructors Association (an industry group):

> If we stay stuck on the current course, our living standards will go backward, with Australians working longer hours for less money.

Productivity has nothing to do with wages - and working longer hours **contributes** to decreasing productivity, not the other way around!!

As an aside, one of the ways to increase productivity in the construction industry would be to reform the apprentice system, pay higher wages, and encourage more people to become skilled tradespeople.

Open the room to discussion on the dot points

Productivity is about quantities, and not about costs. Its the rate at which we produce goods or services per unit of input. How many workers does it take to make a widget?

Productivity is also about technological progress. If a new technology enables the production of the same number of goods in fewer man-hours, that increases productivity. But these are the decisions of management, not the decisions of workers.

Measuring productivity is really hard. Output per worker-hour in industries which make a single output (like a car) is straightforward. But what about the interaction between capital and worker? How can you measure the output per capital-worker-hour? What does that even mean?

Speaking of the Productivity Commission, their report into productivity identified that estimates of productivity are constantly being revised - sometimes by 0.5 percentage points or more. The June quarter estimate of productivity growth was 0.5%. There is a huge potential for error - there's a big difference between 0%, 0.5%, and 1.0%.

Estimates of productivity in non-market sectors like education, or health care, are even more ridiculous. What is the output you're measuring? Number of students graduating? Number of patients discharged? If that's the case, productivity would go up by reducing the number of teachers or the number of nurses.

Finally, real wages and productivity decoupled long ago. Increased productivity no longer translates with increases in real wages. That means that private business is getting more output per unit of input, but they are not passing that on to the workers who actually supply their labour. Instead, productivity growth contributes to increasing worker exploitation through increased profit margins. How that profit is spent is then up to the capitalist, not the worker.

# **Section 2**: Chatting Economics

> The purpose of studying economics is not to acquire a set of ready-made answers to economic questions, but to learn how to avoid being deceived by economists.

::: notes
We're going to talk about:

\- inflation, productivity, unemployment rate, and tariffs

\- why "economic good news" doesn't necessarily translate to how you feel

Hopefully give you confidence to talk about economic indicators, by letting you know the tricks that "economists" use.
:::

## Inflation (or, the Consumer Price Index)

::: notes
By their nature, averages are not representative of individuals. Statistical agencies have to make a lot of decisions when calculating price indices, including:

-   What goes into the basket?

-   How should like items be grouped?

-   How should each group be weighted into the overall?

-   How often should the weighting change?

Ultimately, the basket of goods and services does not represent the spending or expenditure patterns of any one individual. There will be a disconnect between how the CPI is reported, and how you feel it as an individual. That doesn't mean your feelings are wrong, or that you're spending money 'incorrectly'. It also means that we should not accept pay rises equal to changes in the CPI.

Note that I specified housing as a good/service that is included in the consumer price index. What would you expect that to measure? The cost of housing is measured as the price of a new home (excluding land). Mortgage payments are excluded.
:::

-   The CPI is a measure of changes in the price of a "basket" of goods and services.
-   The basket includes (among other things):
    -   Food and non-alcoholic beverages, alcohol and tobacco and housing
-   It represents the average inflation experience - and is **not** reflective of changes in cost of living.

## Reporting Inflation - Index

-   CPI data is reported as an ***index***, or as a % change compared to the previous quarter, or previous year.
    -   an *index* shows how prices have changed relative to a value of 100 in a reference period.

::: notes
The ABS indexes the CPI such that the 2011/12 financial year = 100. All index numbers are reported relative to this period. That means that an index of 110 in March 2020 would mean that prices have increased by 10% since the 2011/12 financial year.
:::

## Reporting Inflation - Percentage Change

-   CPI data is reported as an index, or as a **% change in since last month, last quarter, or last year.**
    -   A percentage change measures the relative change in prices compared to another period.

::: notes
Annual Change

-   The *annual change* is a measure of the price now compared to the price one year ago.

Change from Previous Quarter:

-   The *change from previous quarter* is a measure of the price now compared to the price 3 months ago.

Example 1

-   An annual change of 7.8% in December 2022 means prices in December 2022 were 7.8% higher than they were in December 2021.

Example 2

-   A change from previous quarter of -1.9% in June 2020 means that prices in June 2020 were 1.9% lower than they were in March 2020.
:::

## Reporting Inflation

::: notes
Tab 1

-   This is the % change way of measuring inflation.

-   Inflation goes up when the % change in one period is higher than the last period

-   All the numbers (except for one in 2020) are positive. In fact, since the September quarter of 1948, inflation has only been negative 5 times.

Tab 2:

-   Now looking at the index number approach.

-   Decreasing inflation is usually presented in the media as good news. But because inflation measures the rate of change of a rate of change (i.e. how much the change in prices changed), decreasing inflation just means that prices didn't increase as fast.

-   The index measure shows you the effect of 'cumulative' inflation on prices.

## Inflation - By Type

::: notes
Reported inflation tends to focus on the overall average - but it's collected at a highly disaggregated level, of 87 different groups.

Things that have increased faster than the average since March 2020 include: housing, food, alcohol and tobacco, health, transport, education, and insurance

Compared to things which have gone down? Clothing and footwear, and furnishings...

Other weird things about inflation - it hasn't included mortgage repayments (since 1998).

## Inflation - Cost of Living

::: notes
As mentioned previously, the CPI is not a measure of the cost of living. In fact there is no definitive cost of living measure collected by the ABS but the ABS does collect a living cost index, which looks at different household types expenditure patterns.

The living cost index asks "By how much would after tax money incomes need to change to allow households to purchase the same quantity of consumer goods and services that they purchased in the base period?"

## Inflation - Wages

::: notes
What is relevant to everyone is how well wages are keeping up with increased costs. It isn't particularly worrisome if the price of everything doubles but your income also doubles.

Unfortunately it's not really that easy to tell if this is happening or not.

Does it feel to you that things are more expensive relative to how much your earning?

Because the CPI is measured using a basket of goods, which is supposed to represent the 'average' consumer, it is guaranteed that your experience is different - because you buy different things in different proportions than the "representative" consumer.

But we can look at the "real" value of wages - how far their purchasing power goes. And here we have another trick of the economist. How do you convert "nominal" dollars - how much you earn today (or yesterday) into "real" dollars - how much does that dollar buy you?

Different economists will use different "deflators" to convert nominal dollars into real dollars. The one they choose will often be the one that tells the story they want to tell. They can trick by setting the index at a different point in time.

Whether we compare wage increases with increases in the CPI, or increases in the cost of living, it is clear that wages today are worth only about as much as they were in 2010/11.

## What Inflation Is Not

::: incremental
-   Inflation is not a measure of the cost of living.

-   Decreasing inflation does not mean prices have gone down.

-   Inflation is not more important than any other economic indicator.
:::

## Productivity

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00npeUY_1Vg width="100%" height="85%">}}

## Productivity (or, output per hour worked)

-   **Labour** Productivity is a measure of Gross Domestic Product per hour worked.
-   But there are other inputs into production besides labour, including capital
-   Changes in output can occur even without changes to input

::: notes
For example, you could lose output in Agriculture from bad weather destroying a crop. Similarly, you could gain output in Mining because high prices make some difficult deposits worth mining.

Labour productivity is the most commonly reported productivity. It is relatively simple to measure and describe.
:::

## Productivity - Measurement Issues

-   It is relatively easy to measure and describe output per worker.
-   Measuring output per unit of labour **and** capital is much more complicated, and questionable.
    -   What is a unit of labour-capital?
-   Measuring productivity in the public sector basically shouldn't be done.
    -   You would increase productivity in Education by reducing the number of teachers per student.

## Productivity Trends

::: notes
GDP per hour worked, with June 1991 set as the base or reference year.

-   Growth was slowing prior to 2020 anyway, with the increases seen during then probably due to the pandemic.

-   This has been called a productivity 'bubble' which I think I agree with.

-   Periods of slow growth have been occurring since the 2000s really.

## Productivity Trends - 20 Years

::: notes
Productivity is a volatile measure. It is better to measure it across a long time period.

The ABS uses a 20 year average "compound average growth rate" formula.

-   Clearly not a new problem
-   20-year average productivity growth was pretty stable up until about 2013
-   Significant declines since then. Covid rebound probably an illusion

## Productivity Trends

::: notes
Productivity is measured as GDP per hour worked. So we need to look at what is happening with hours worked, and with GDP.

I don't know about you but the increase in hours worked looks like it's pretty steep.

What do we think could have caused that? Are you working more hours? Do you know people who are working more hours? Why?

Could it be people working more hours because they're struggling to make ends meet because of inflation?

Even the Productivity Commission recognise that high hours worked is pulling productivity down

## Productivity Trends - Workers Share

-   If productivity is a measure of output per hour, it would only be fair to compare that with how much compensation (in real terms) workers are getting per hour.

## Economic Anxiety

::: notes
Before we move onto the next section, I wanted to stop for a discussion about how you relate to the economy.

How do you feel about the "big picture" economy?

How do you feel about your economic situation?

How do your neighbours, mates, colleagues feel?

If you're feeling anxious, I don't blame you.

The world has become increasingly competitive, and isolated. The rise of neo-liberalism, the decline in the power of labour, and the increased concentration of wealth have been disastrous.

Workers are more precarious than ever:

-   gig economy, 0-hour contract, no protection, a safety net that isn't safe at all.

Workers are forced to pursue their personal monetary interest, because you need to to survive. This competition, and precarity, are used to keep employees divided, and to try and minimise solidarity between workers. And it's been happening since the 1980s. It is scary to put your head above the parapet and ask for better conditions because there is so much to lose.

Solidarity is more important than ever. We are powerful as a collective.

## Tariffs {.center background-image="img/trump.webp" background-color="black"}

## Definition

-   A tariff is essentially a tax charged on imported goods.
-   The tariff is paid by the *importer*, not the exporter.
-   Increased costs for the importer will be passed on to the final consumer.

## Tariffs in the US

::: notes
Trade surplus countries take advantage by using subsidies on domestic production, manipulate currency to keep their exchange rate low, and have their own tariffs on US imports.

The impact on domestic industry (through price competition) resonates a lot with workers I think.

The impact of deindustrialisation on the US (and other western economies) is real, and has caused significant community disruption, and destruction. Former (and current) industrial towns in the Midwest have suffered real impacts.

Trump isn't even arguing that the tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs in the US, instead focusing on using AI, automation, and robotics to do the work.

So even if it's successful, even if the argument is believable, there is no room in the policy for workers to share the benefits. There is certainly no guarantee that a revitalised manufacturing industry in the US, brought upon by tariffs, would bring back many if any manufacturing jobs.
:::

The argument goes something like this:

::: incremental
-   The US is 'taken advantage of' by countries who export more to the US than the import.

-   Dependence on foreign goods undermines domestic industry.

-   Putting up tariffs reduces demand for imports and increases demand for domestic production (through price changes)

-   Increase demand restores America's manufacturing base.
:::

## Tariffs to Protect Industry

::: notes
It's a classic "pull the ladder up after you" situation.
:::

::: incremental
Tariffs are not new.

-   Protecting local industry has long played a role in capitalist development.
-   Tariffs have been used to protect new industries in developing/industrialising countries.
-   Britain relied on high tariffs to develop their industry. Once developed, tariffs were disavowed in favour of "free markets" and global trade.
:::

## Tariffs to Reindustrialise

::: notes
US manufacturing moved off-shore as capitalists sought higher profit through lower labour costs during a period where the US dollar was very high. The US dollar was very high because Paul Volcker increased interest rates to 19% to curb inflation (through demand destruction, i.e. make everyone unemployed and poor)

The question is - can tariffs work for a country trying to reindustrialise?

America is a special case. If it could work for anyone, it would be them.

They maintain economic, political, and military power over much of the rest of the world - especially across the west.

But the strategy still faces significant head winds, including:

-   Final product manufacturing in the US still requires intermediate inputs which are sourced from all over the world. So the price increase still gets passed on to domestic production!

-   There's not sufficient domestic capabilities to meet consumers demand. But the price increases are already coming.

-   With no comprehensive industrial strategy, investment and onshoring just means that manufacturing firms would have to accept lower profits out of the kindness of their hearts. Do we think the capitalist would do that?

Even if it works for them, it is not going to be a viable strategy for the rest of us.
:::

-   America can probably extract concessions from the vassal states like South Korea and Japan.

    -   If you're cynical, that might include Australia and the UK too.

-   But, the stated strategy is relying on automation, AI, and robotics to do the work - not people.

-   Globalisation means value chains are now spread across the world, so domestic prices will increase.

-   Without significant investment into domestic manufacturing, demand can't actually be met by local industry.

## Tariffs to Protect Capital

::: notes
In response to declining profit, capitalists try to discipline labour, move production somewhere cheaper, inflates asset bubbles, and retreat behind protective barriers.\
\
You have probably felt and noticed this over the course of your working lives.

Most likely what is going on is that the capital class is using tariffs to try and protect their profits because they are no longer competitive.
:::

-   The rate of profit has a tendency to fall over time.

-   Seeking constant productivity growth, capitalist investment focuses on machinery and technology at the expense of labour - reducing profit.

-   US tariffs are intended to protect US capital from more productive or lower cost competitors, and to shift the burden of declining profitability off shore.

-   This is a temporary solution. The time could be used to develop comprehensive industry policy to revitalise production, or it could be used to keep the plates spinning a bit longer.

# **Section 3:** Industrial Capabilities

> What you make is what you know

## Industrial Capabilities

-   Core concepts:
    -   a country makes (or does) what it knows
    -   products (or activities) represent combinations of knowledge
-   Capabilities are like letters in Scrabble
    -   The more you have, the more words you can make
    -   Rare letters create words worth more points

## Products Embody Knowledge

## Measuring Industrial Capabilities

-   Export data reveals what a country makes
-   Comparison between countries reveals which capabilities are common, and which are rare
-   The presence of different capabilities in different countries allows a ranking called the Economic Complexity Index

## Why Does It Matter?

-   The Economic Complexity Index is predictive of the direction of future economic growth.
    -   Countries with higher complexity are predicted to grow faster
-   Useful tool to identify productive capabilities of a country.
-   Can be used to identify future opportunities and direct strategy.

## Why Does It Matter to Australia?

::: notes
-   Australia's ranking in 2023 was 105th - Sandwiched between Botswana and Côte d'Ivoire
-   Australia's exports are concentrated in only a few products
-   Australia's exports are lower in average complexity
-   Australia does not have the industrial capabilities of other developed countries.

## What Can Be Done?

::: notes
The problem:

-   is real, will not be solved by the market and will not be solved with small tweaks and adjustments.
:::

-   Recognise that there is a problem.

-   The lack of sufficient existing capabilities requires explicit and direct industrial policy.

-   Understand the connection between just transition, decarbonisation, and reindustrialisation.

-   Develop a policy agenda which explicitly outlines existing and future opportunities, and how to get there.

# **Section 4**: Economics and Economists

## Economics

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPv5oUfsbg width="100%" height="85%">}}

## Economists

::: notes
Economics used to be the realm of the philosopher.

In about the 1950s to 1960s, a new school of economists decided that adding maths equations to economics made it more rigorous, and more scientific.

This shifted the discipline away from thinking about the interaction of the economy and the government, instead thinking of it as an abstract concept which can be modelled, and those models can be used to make predictions.

## What is The Economy?

-   Is the economy how much we produce in total?
-   Is the economy how much we produce per person?
-   Is the economy how well we meet the needs of society?
-   Is the economy how well the stock market is performing?

## Political Economy

::: notes
What we call 'economics' today is very different from what would have been called economics in the 1960s, economics in the 1890s, economics in the 1600s, and economics prior to the invention of agriculture.

The study of economics is ideological. It is a social science, not a hard science. There is no Nobel prize in economics (the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not and is not one of the original 5).

Early economics was philosophical - looking at questions like:

-   What is work? What is production?

-   What is value?

In the 1600s, the dominant ideology of Britain was *mercantilism,* based on the growing power of Britain, and the vast trade networks they had developed through colonialism. The economics of the time was a reflection of this ideology, highlighting the ways in which trade was important for a country's economic development. Economists argued for increased power of the state (to strengthen colonial power) and for government's to maintain a trade surplus.

In France, about 100 years later, the *physiocrats* considered two distinct industries - agricultural, and non-agricultural, in reflection of the growing industrialisation in workshops and of artisans. The physiocrats believed that only agricultural labour could create value in the products of society, and that non-agricultural labour was unproductive.
:::

Despite what economists would have you believe:

::: incremental
-   Economics is not an independent, neutral, or technical system

-   Economics is inherently linked to political ideology.

-   You can't eat "headline inflation fell to 2.4%"
:::

## Political Economy - Modern Economics

::: notes
**Classical Economics**

Prior to and during the industrial revolution, classical economics was developed, primarily through Adam Smith - advancing the theory of the divisibility of labour - that it is more productive for individuals to specialise in one part of the creation of a product, rather than the whole chain. Again - the economics is reflective of the political - increased work in factories, industrial revolution, factory work. Adam Smith is seen by some as the guy who invented free market economics. But Smith was strongly opposed to monopolies, and recognised the importance of *class*, compared to *individual.*

Some ideas have lasted longer than others. Smith's division of labour is still popular today. Others, like Malthus who argued that any wages greater than that required to subside would fuel unstable population growth that absorbed any real income growth, have *mostly* died out.

Ricardo invented a theory of free trade which said that all economies are made better off by specialising in the industry they have comparative advantage which is only true in theory - but is still trotted out by free market advocates today.

**Marxism** was a response to the conditions under which labour was treated during the industrial period - long hours, terrible conditions, high death rates, child labour etc, as well as the growing and obvious disaprities in wealth between the owners of capital, and those who had to work for a living. One insight from Marxism about capitalism is "the tendency for the rate of profit to fall", which says basically, over time, the rate of profit to the amount of invested capital decreases over time. I think that such a theory explains a lot about the development of capitalism and economics since the 1900s.

**Neoclassical**

Focus on the individual, and equilibrium in markets. Bring in mathematics and models to try and answer economic questions. Neoclassical theories are based on abstract ideas, rather than the visible realities. Stuff like:

-   Everyone is born with some endowment of labour power, skill, or another resource.

-   Everyone is born with a set of preferences which determine what they like to consume.

-   Technology converts endowments into usable goods and services.

-   Trading through markets makes sure that everything is optimal.

Which leads to the conclusion that:

-   the market fixes everything and;

-   profit represents the productivity of owned capital - and it is morally justifiable - just explain away the exploitation.

Brief interlude with Keynesianism (explicitly a response to the great depression)- the situation won't resolve itself, and government can stop unemployment by boosting demand (govt spending, taxation, interest rates)

But the return in the 1970s of neoclassical economics (explicitly a response to the stagflation of the 1970s), consolidated today as neoliberalism returns us back to the market solving everyone's problems.

The most important message is:

-   Economics *reflects* the the political ideology, not the other way around!

-   Economists (as social scientists) have ideas about ways that the economy *should* function
:::

-   "Classical" economics is associated with the development of capitalism and the industrial revolution in the late 1700 and early 1800s.

-   Marxism was a response to the horrible working conditions under which labour was subjected during the industrial revolution - and the associated disparity between capital class and working class.

-   Class analysis was neglected in the late 1800s and early 1900s in favour of analysis of individuals. This is "Neo Classical" economics, and is what they teach at University.

-   When thinking of economics, it is fundamental to consider:

    -   

## Value

-   Everything in the economy comes from some combination of work and the natural environment

-   Only work can "add value"

-   However you want to define value - productive labour is the only source of it.

-   Capital is not inherently 'productive' - which means profit must represent the capture of the surplus that workers produce.

## The capitalist class / the working class

-   Capital realism/hypernormalisation

## The role of the State in preserving the status quo

## Solidarity among the working class

# What is to be done?

-   industry policy
-   collective power and class solidarity
