# Talking about Economic Concepts

## Run Sheet

-   Definitions of commonly used terms
-   Inflation, Productivity, Unemployment rate, Tariffs
-   Relationship between numbers and material conditions

## Inflation (or, the Consumer Price Index)

-   The CPI is a measure of changes in the price of a "basket" of goods and services.
-   The basket includes (among other things):
    -   Food and non-alcoholic beverages
    -   Alcohol and tobacco
    -   Housing
-   It represents the average inflation experience - and is **not** reflective of changes in cost of living.

## Reporting Inflation - Index

-   CPI data is reported as an **index**, or as a % change compared to the previous quarter, or previous year.
    -   an *index* shows how prices have changed relative to a value of 100 in the reference period.
    -   The CPI is indexed so that the 2011/12 financial year is considered 100.
    -   An index of 110 in March 2020 would mean that prices have increased by 10% since the reference period.

## Reporting Inflation - Percentage Change
-   CPI data is reported as an index, or as a **% change in since last month, last quarter, or last year.**
    -   A percentage change measures the relative change in prices compared to another period.
    -   The *annual change* is a measure of the price now compared to the price one year ago.
    -   The *change from previous quarter* is a measure of the price now compared to the price 3 months ago.

::: notes
Example 1: An annual change of 7.8% in December 2022 means prices in December 2022 were 7.8% higher than they were in December 2021.
Example 2: A change from previous quarter of -1.9% in June 2020 means that prices in June 2020 were 1.9% lower than they were in March 2020. 
:::

## Reporting Inflation
::: notes
Column 1: This is the % change way of measuring inflation. Inflation goes up when the % change in one period is higher than the last period All the numbers (except for one in 2020) are positive.

Column 2: Now looking at the index number approach.

## Inflation - By Type
::: notes
Reported inflation tends to focus on the overall average - but it's collected at a highly disaggregated level.

Things that have increased faster than the average since March 2020 include: housing, food, alcohol and tobacco, health, transport, education, and insurance

Compared to things which have gone down? Clothing and footwear, and furnishings... 

Other weird things about inflation - it hasn't included mortgage repayments (since 1998).

## Inflation - Cost of Living
::: notes
as mentioned previously, the cpi is not a measure of the cost of living. 
in fact there is no definitive cost of living measure collected by the ABS
but the ABS does collect a living cost index

```{r}
lci <- read_abs_local("6467.0", filenames = "646702.xlsx", path = "data") |>

probably some kind of discussion about whether wages are keeping up with inflation

```

## Tariffs

-   What is a tariff?
-   Tariffs throughout history
-   Are tariffs inherently bad?
-   Protectionism, reindustrialisation
-   Institutions, (neo)liberalism

## Productivity (or, output per hour worked)
- **Labour** Productivity is a measure of Gross Domestic Product per hour worked. 
  -   How many workers does it take to produce 1 widget?
- But there are other inputs into production besides labour, including capital
- Changes in output can occur even without changes to input

::: notes
For example, you could lose output in Agriculture from bad weather destroying a crop.
Similarly, you could gain output in Mining because high prices make some difficult deposits worth mining.

Labour productivity is the most commonly reported productivity. It is relatively simple to measure and describe.
:::

## Productivity - Measurement Issues
- It is relatively easy to measure and describe output per worker.
- Measuring output per unit of labour **and** capital is much more complicated, and questionable. 
  -   What is a unit of labour-capital?
- Measuring productivity in the public sector basically shouldn't be done.
  -   You would increase productivity in Education by reducing the number of teachers per student.

## Productivity Trends 

```{r}
national_accounts |> 
 filter(series == "GDP per hour worked: Index ;",
        !is.na(value)) |> 
  mutate(index = 100*value/value[date == "1991-06-01"]) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = index, col = "labour_productivity")) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "GDP per Hour Worked (June 1991 = 100)") +
  theme_nrc() +
  labs(y = "index",
       x = NULL)
```

## Drivers of Productivity

-   Productivity can decrease (numerically) if:
    -   hours worked increases faster than output
    -   output decreases
    
::: notes
As explained before, output can decrease independent of changes to inputs.
Additionally, hours worked can be strongly influenced by seasonal trends.

# Industrial Capabilities

-   Core concepts:
    -   a country makes (or does) what it knows
    -   products (or activities) represent combinations of knowledge
-   Capabilities are like letters in Scrabble
    -   The more you have, the more words you can make
    -   Rare letters create words worth more points

## Measuring Industrial Capabilities

-   Export data reveals what a country makes
-   Comparison between countries reveals which capabilities are common, and which are rare
-   The presence of different capabilities in different countries allows a ranking called the Economic Complexity Index

## Why does it matter?

-   The Economic Complexity Index is predictive of the direction of future economic growth.
    -   Countries with higher complexity are predicted to grow faster
-   Useful tool to identify productive capabilities of a country
-   Can be used to identify future opportunities

## Why does it matter to Australia?

- Australia's ranking in 2023 was 105th - Sandwiched between Botswana and Côte d'Ivoire - Australia's exports are concentrated in only a few products - Australia's exports are lower in average complexity - Australia does not have the industrial capabilities of other developed countries.

## What is The Economy?

-   Is the economy how much we produce in total?
-   Is the economy how much we produce per person?
-   Is the economy how well we meet the needs of society?
-   Is the economy the stock market?

## Everyone Hates Economists

-   Paid too much
-   Don't care enough about material conditions
-   Let them eat headline inflation
