# Section 2: Talking about Economic Concepts

::: notes
We're going to talk about: - inflation, productivity, unemployment rate, and tariffs - why "economic good news" doesn't necessarily translate to how you feel
:::

## Inflation (or, the Consumer Price Index)

-   The CPI is a measure of changes in the price of a "basket" of goods and services.
-   The basket includes (among other things):
    -   Food and non-alcoholic beverages
    -   Alcohol and tobacco
    -   Housing
-   It represents the average inflation experience - and is **not** reflective of changes in cost of living.

## Reporting Inflation - Index

-   CPI data is reported as an **index**, or as a % change compared to the previous quarter, or previous year.
    -   an *index* shows how prices have changed relative to a value of 100 in the reference period.
    -   The CPI is indexed so that the 2011/12 financial year is considered 100.
    -   An index of 110 in March 2020 would mean that prices have increased by 10% since the reference period.

## Reporting Inflation - Percentage Change

-   CPI data is reported as an index, or as a **% change in since last month, last quarter, or last year.**
    -   A percentage change measures the relative change in prices compared to another period.
    
::: notes
Annual Change:     
    -   The *annual change* is a measure of the price now compared to the price one year ago.
Change from Previous Quarter:
    -   The *change from previous quarter* is a measure of the price now compared to the price 3 months ago.
Example 1:
An annual change of 7.8% in December 2022 means prices in December 2022 were 7.8% higher than they were in December 2021. Example 2: A change from previous quarter of -1.9% in June 2020 means that prices in June 2020 were 1.9% lower than they were in March 2020.
:::

## Reporting Inflation

::: notes
Tab 1: This is the % change way of measuring inflation. Inflation goes up when the % change in one period is higher than the last period All the numbers (except for one in 2020) are positive.

Tab 2: Now looking at the index number approach.

Decreasing inflation is usually presented in the media as good news. But because inflation measures the rate of change of a rate, decreasing inflation just means that prices didn't increase as fast. The index measure shows you the effect of 'cumulative' inflation on prices.

## Inflation - By Type

::: notes
Reported inflation tends to focus on the overall average - but it's collected at a highly disaggregated level.

Things that have increased faster than the average since March 2020 include: housing, food, alcohol and tobacco, health, transport, education, and insurance

Compared to things which have gone down? Clothing and footwear, and furnishings...

Other weird things about inflation - it hasn't included mortgage repayments (since 1998).

## Inflation - Cost of Living

::: notes
as mentioned previously, the cpi is not a measure of the cost of living. in fact there is no definitive cost of living measure collected by the ABS but the ABS does collect a living cost index "By how much would after tax money incomes need to change to allow households to purchase the same quantity of consumer goods and services that they purchased in the base period?"

## Economic anxiety

-   feel stressed?
-   capitalism got you down?
-   you are right to feel anxious
-   you are forced to pursue your personal (monetary) interest because you need to to survive
    -   employers use this to divide
    -   hard to build solidarity
-   weaponised since at least the 80s
-   the value of solidarity

## Productivity
{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00npeUY_1Vg width="100%" height="85%">}}


## Productivity (or, output per hour worked)

-   **Labour** Productivity is a measure of Gross Domestic Product per hour worked.
    -   How many workers does it take to produce 1 widget?
-   But there are other inputs into production besides labour, including capital
-   Changes in output can occur even without changes to input

::: notes
For example, you could lose output in Agriculture from bad weather destroying a crop. Similarly, you could gain output in Mining because high prices make some difficult deposits worth mining.

Labour productivity is the most commonly reported productivity. It is relatively simple to measure and describe.
:::

## Productivity - Measurement Issues

-   It is relatively easy to measure and describe output per worker.
-   Measuring output per unit of labour **and** capital is much more complicated, and questionable.
    -   What is a unit of labour-capital?
-   Measuring productivity in the public sector basically shouldn't be done.
    -   You would increase productivity in Education by reducing the number of teachers per student.

## Productivity Trends

::: notes
I don't know about you but the increase in hours worked looks like it's pretty steep. What do we think could have caused that? Could it be people working more hours because they're struggling to make ends meet because of inflation? Even the Productivity Commission recognise that high hours worked is pulling productivity down

-   Protectionism, reindustrialisation
-   Institutions, (neo)liberalism

# Section 3: Industrial Capabilities

-   Core concepts:
    -   a country makes (or does) what it knows
    -   products (or activities) represent combinations of knowledge
-   Capabilities are like letters in Scrabble
    -   The more you have, the more words you can make
    -   Rare letters create words worth more points

## Measuring Industrial Capabilities

-   Export data reveals what a country makes
-   Comparison between countries reveals which capabilities are common, and which are rare
-   The presence of different capabilities in different countries allows a ranking called the Economic Complexity Index

## Why does it matter?

-   The Economic Complexity Index is predictive of the direction of future economic growth.
    -   Countries with higher complexity are predicted to grow faster
-   Useful tool to identify productive capabilities of a country
-   Can be used to identify future opportunities

## Economists

::: notes
Economics used to be the realm of the philosopher. In about the 1950s or 1960s, a new school of economists decided that adding maths equations to economics made it more rigorous, and more scientific.

## Political Economy

-   Despite what economists would have you believe:
-   Economics is not an independent, neutral, or technical system
-   Economics is inseparable from politics
-   You can't eat "headline inflation fell to 2.4%"

## What is The Economy?

-   Is the economy how much we produce in total?
-   Is the economy how much we produce per person?
-   Is the economy how well we meet the needs of society?
-   Is the economy how well the stock market is performing?

##  Value
-   Everything in the economy comes from some combination of work and the natural environment
-   Only work can "add value" 
-   However you want to define value - productive labour is the only source of it. 
-   Capital is not inherently 'productive' - which means profit must represent the capture of the surplus that workers produce. 
## The capitalist class / the working class

-   Capital realism/hypernormalisation

## The role of the State in preserving the status quo

## Solidarity among the working class

# What is to be done?

-   industry policy
-   collective power and class solidarity
