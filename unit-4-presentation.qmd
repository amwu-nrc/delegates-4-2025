# Questions on Notice

## Inflation

-   How is inflation measured?
-   What happens to prices when inflation goes down?
-   Is there a contradiction between how inflation is felt, compared to how it is reported?

## Tariffs

-   What is a tariff?
-   Tariffs throughout history
-   Are tariffs inherently bad?
-   Protectionism, reindustrialisation

## Productivity

-   What is productivity?
-   How is productivity measured?
-   What drives changes in productivity?

# Talking about Economic Concepts - Start of Day 2
-   What is inflation, productivity, a tariff
-   Why does it feel bad even when number good
-   Common arguments (lies) "economists" use

## Inflation (or, the Consumer Price Index)
- The CPI is a measure of changes in the price of a "basket" of goods and services.
- The basket includes (among other things):
    -   Food and non-alcoholic beverages
    -   Alcohol and tobacco
    -   Housing
- CPI data is reported as an index, or as a % change since last month, last quarter, or last year.

## Reporting Inflation 

::: {.notes}
This is the % change way of measuring inflation.
Inflation goes up when the % change in one period is higher than the last period
All the numbers (except for one in 2020) are positive.

## Tariffs

## Productivity

```{r}
national_accounts |> 
 filter(series == "GDP per hour worked: Index ;",
        !is.na(value)) |> 
  mutate(index = 100*value/value[date == "1991-06-01"]) |>

  labs(y = "index",
       x = NULL)
```

## Drivers of Productivity

-   Productivity can decrease if:
    -   hours worked increases faster than output
    -   output decreases

## Hours Worked

```{r}
national_accounts |> 
  filter(series == "Hours worked: Index ;",
         !is.na(value)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value, col = 'hours')) + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme_nrc() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = "hours worked: index")
```

## GDP

## Sector

```{r}
national_accounts |> 
  filter(table_no == "5204015_Labour_Productivity_Input",
         str_detect(series, "GVA"),
         !is.na(value)) |>
  mutate(industry = str_extract(series, "^(.*?);"),
         industry = trimws(str_remove_all(industry, ";"))) |>
group_by(industry) |> 
  mutate(index = 100*value/value[date == "1998-06-01"]) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = index, col = industry)) + 
  geom_line() +
  gghighlight(industry %in% c("ALL INDUSTRIES")) +
  theme_nrc() +
  labs(y = "gross value added per hour worked",
       x = NULL)
```

## Productivity

-   Per hour worked

## Industrial Capabilities

-   Core concepts:
    -   a country makes (or does) what it knows
    -   products (or activities) represent combinations of knowledge
- Capabilities are like letters in Scrabble
    -   The more you have, the more words you can make
    -   Rare letters create words worth more points

## Industrial Capabilities

## Measuring Industrial Capabilities

-   Export data reveals what a country makes
-   Comparison between countries reveals which capabilities are common, and which are rare
-   The presence of different capabilities in different countries allows a ranking called the Economic Complexity Index

## Why does it matter?
-   The Economic Complexity Index is predictive of the direction of future economic growth. 
    -   Countries with higher complexity are predicted to grow faster
-   Useful tool to identify productive capabilities of a country
-   Can be used to identify future opportunities

## Why does it matter to Australia?
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](img/aus complexity rank.svg)
:::
:::{.column width = "50%"}
-   Australia's ranking in 2023 was 105th
    -   Sandwiched between Botswana and CÃ´te d'Ivoire
-   Australia's exports are concentrated in only a few products
-   Australia's exports are lower in average complexity
-   Australia does not have the industrial capabilities of other developed countries.

## Political Economy

## What is The Economy?

-   Is the economy how much we produce in total?
-   Is the economy how much we produce per person?
-   Is the economy how well we meet the needs of society?
-   Is the economy the stock market?

## Everyone Hates Economists

-   Paid too much
-   Don't care enough about material conditions
-   Let them eat headline inflation ::: ::::
